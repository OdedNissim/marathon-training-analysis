# Marathon Training Analysis

In 2023, while serving as an Operational Officer in the Israeli Navy, I began training for my first marathon. 
After only eight weeks, an ITB injury forced me to stop for three months.
Two and a half years later, after completing a six-month journey across South America, I decided to try again, this time with a structured plan and the guidance of a professional coach.
As part of this process, I launched a data project analyzing my Garmin training records from both 2023 and 2025. The goal: to identify patterns, understand the early signals of injury, and explore what makes my current preparation stronger and more sustainable.

Through this project, I will share key insights and takeaways from my marathon training data, highlighting lessons in running, training structure, and broader applications for life and business.

##  Weekly Running Volume
The following graph shows the total kilometers and training hours per week

### Description
- In 2023, weekly running volume and time were significantly higher but unstable, with a sharp decline in the last two weeks due to injury onset in week six.
- In 2025, training emphasized gradual, consistent progression, focusing on controlled heart rate and stable pacing.
- The variation is clearly illustrated in the graph depicting the absolute week-to-week changes in distance.

##  Rest Days Between Runs
The following graph illustrates the number of rest days between each run.

### Description
- In 2023, rest days vary widely, including 5–6 day gaps, creating near-week-long inactivity with higher load on remaining runs.
- In 2025, the schedule is structured with three weekly sessions on consistent days, so most runs are followed by 1–2 rest days.
  
##  Average Pace per Heart Rate Zones
The following graph shows average pace and aerobic heart rate zone.

### Description
- Aerobic Training (AEROBIC TE): Exercise performed at moderate intensity that relies primarily on oxygen-dependent energy systems to improve cardiovascular endurance and efficiency.
- Scale 1–5: Intensity levels from low (1) to high (5) within the aerobic zone, indicating effort and heart rate relative to individual aerobic capacity.
- In 2023, several runs reached Zone 5, indicating anaerobic efforts and high week-to-week variability, a clear marker of elevated load and injury risk.
- In 2025, paces are steadier with moderate aerobic zones, reflecting a structured approach emphasizing controlled intensity and endurance development.

##  Key Insights
### Running Insights
1. **“The height of the peak is defined by the width of the base”**
    
   The data clearly show that long-term progress depends on building a broad, stable foundation. The gradual, consistent mileage increase in 2025 created durability and balance, unlike the unstable, injury-prone buildup       of 2023, which lacked sufficient aerobic base development.
   
2. **“Smooth is strong, and strong is fast”**
   
   Performance improvement stems from controlled, consistent effort. In 2025, steadier pacing and balanced heart rate zones reflect efficient aerobic conditioning, a sign that sustainable progress is achieved through
   rhythm, not extremes.
   
3. **“Discipline builds resilience”**
   
   The structured 2025 schedule, with regular rest patterns and measured intensity, demonstrates how disciplined training fosters physical resilience and recovery capacity, essential for maintaining performance over time.

### Lessons for Business and Life
1. **Leverage the right people**
   
    Effective growth is amplified by collaboration and expertise. Surrounding yourself with the right mentors and professionals accelerates progress, reduces errors, and transforms knowledge into actionable results. In
    2025,   partnering with a professional coach translated into structured, efficient, and measurable improvement.

3. **Trust the process**
   
    Sustainable success requires patience and structured effort. Monitoring feedback, iterating deliberately, and adhering to a disciplined plan transforms consistent practice into long-term outcomes while mitigating risks
    and setbacks.

3. **Patience compounds**
   
   Foundations determine potential. Gradual, intentional development builds resilience, capacity, and reliability, creating leverage for future challenges. Skipping foundational steps may deliver short-term gains but
   increases the likelihood of failure; steady accumulation maximizes lasting impact.

##  Summary
Analyzing my marathon training data from 2023 and 2025 revealed striking differences in structure, intensity, and recovery, and clear early warning signs of injury in 2023 that I now understand and have learned from.

Diving into the data, creating graphs, and using GitHub and Markdown for the first time was an exhilarating experience. I’m halfway to my big goal: **the Dead Sea Marathon 2026**, and I feel stronger, smarter, and more determined than ever.

I will continue to share updates.
