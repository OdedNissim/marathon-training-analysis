# Marathon Training Analysis

In 2023, while serving as an Operational Officer in the Israeli Navy, I began training for my first marathon. 
After only eight weeks, an ITB injury forced me to stop for three months.
Two and a half years later, after completing a six-month journey across South America, I decided to try again, this time with a structured plan and the guidance of a professional coach.
As part of this process, I launched a data project analyzing my Garmin training records from both 2023 and 2025. The goal: to identify patterns, understand the early signals of injury, and explore what makes my current preparation stronger and more sustainable.

I will share key insights and takeaways, about running, training, and improvement, through this project.

##  Weekly Running Volume
The following graph shows the total kilometers and training hours per week

### Description
- In 2023, weekly running volume and time were significantly higher but unstable, with a sharp decline in the last two weeks due to injury onset in week six.
- In 2025, training emphasized gradual, consistent progression, focusing on controlled heart rate and stable pacing.
- The variation is clearly illustrated in the graph depicting the absolute week-to-week changes in distance.

##  Rest Days Between Runs
The following graph illustrates the number of rest days between each run.

### Description
- In 2023, rest days vary widely, including 5–6 day gaps, creating near-week-long inactivity with higher load on remaining runs.
- In 2025, the schedule is structured with three weekly sessions on consistent days, so most runs are followed by 1–2 rest days.
  
##  Average Pace per Heart Rate Zones
The following graph shows average pace and aerobic heart rate zone.

### Description
- Aerobic Training (AEROBIC TE): Exercise performed at moderate intensity that relies primarily on oxygen-dependent energy systems to improve cardiovascular endurance and efficiency.
- Scale 1–5: Intensity levels from low (1) to high (5) within the aerobic zone, indicating effort and heart rate relative to individual aerobic capacity.
- In 2023, several runs reached Zone 5, indicating anaerobic efforts and high week-to-week variability, a clear marker of elevated load and injury risk.
- In 2025, paces are steadier with moderate aerobic zones, reflecting a structured approach emphasizing controlled intensity and endurance development.

##  Key Insights
- Long, **slow-distance runs** provided a strong aerobic foundation.  
- Short **interval workouts** improved my ability to sustain faster paces.  
- Planned **recovery weeks** every 3–4 weeks prevented overtraining and injuries.  

---

##  Next Steps
- Add analysis of **Heart Rate Zones** (aerobic vs anaerobic balance).  
- Compare current training with my **2023 marathon prep**, where I experienced injury.  
- Incorporate **nutrition and sleep data** for holistic performance insights.
