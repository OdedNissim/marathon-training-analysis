# Marathon Training Analysis

In 2023, while serving as an Operational Officer in the Israeli Navy, I began training for my first marathon. 
After only eight weeks, an ITB injury forced me to stop for three months.
Two and a half years later, after completing a six-month journey across South America, I decided to try again, this time with a structured plan and the guidance of a professional coach.
As part of this process, I launched a data project analyzing my Garmin training records from both 2023 and 2025. The goal: to identify patterns, understand the early signals of injury, and explore what makes my current preparation stronger and more sustainable.

Through this project, I will share key insights and takeaways from my marathon training data, highlighting lessons in running, training structure, and broader applications for life and business.

##  Weekly Running Volume
The following graph shows the total running distance per week.

![Weekly Volume](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bd5f675-3d9f-4f70-8f18-441ca5dc89cb)

- In 2023, weekly running volume was significantly higher, with a sharp decline in the last two weeks due to injury onset in week six.
- In 2025, training emphasized gradual, consistent progression, focusing on controlled heart rate and stable pacing.
- The variation is clearly illustrated in the graph depicting the absolute week-to-week changes in distance.

- In 2023, weekly distance increased irregularly, with fluctuations of up to 5 km between consecutive weeks, indicating poor load management and contributing to injury risk.
- In 2025, weekly changes were smaller and more consistent (1–3 km), reflecting controlled progression and improved training stability.

##  Rest Days Between Runs
The following graph illustrates the number of rest days between each run.

- In 2023, rest intervals were highly inconsistent, ranging from back-to-back training days to gaps of up to six days, indicating poor load distribution and recovery management.
- In 2025, rest periods were structured, with most sessions followed by one rest day and no extended breaks. This pattern reflects improved frequency control, balanced recovery, and greater training stability.

##  Average Pace per Heart Rate Zones
The following graph shows average pace and aerobic heart rate zone.

![Pace vs Heart Rate Zone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6a81eed-73de-4f1d-af9d-7711856fbc11)

- **Aerobic Training (AEROBIC TE):** Exercise performed at moderate intensity that relies primarily on oxygen-dependent energy systems to improve cardiovascular endurance and efficiency.

  **Scale 1–5:** Intensity levels from low (1) to high (5) within the aerobic zone, indicating effort and heart rate relative to individual aerobic capacity.
- In 2023, several runs reached Zone 5, indicating anaerobic efforts and high week-to-week variability, a clear marker of elevated load and injury risk.
- In 2025, paces are steadier with moderate aerobic zones, reflecting a structured approach emphasizing controlled intensity and endurance development.

##  Key Insights
### Running Insights
1. **“The height of the peak is defined by the width of the base”**
    
   The data clearly show that long-term progress depends on building a broad, stable foundation. The gradual, consistent mileage increase in 2025 created durability and balance, unlike the unstable, injury-prone buildup       of 2023, which lacked sufficient aerobic base development.
   
2. **“Smooth is strong, and strong is fast”**
   
   Performance improvement stems from controlled, consistent effort. In 2025, steadier pacing and balanced heart rate zones reflect efficient aerobic conditioning, a sign that sustainable progress is achieved through
   rhythm, not extremes.
   
3. **“Discipline builds resilience”**
   
   The structured 2025 schedule, with regular rest patterns and measured intensity, demonstrates how disciplined training fosters physical resilience and recovery capacity, essential for maintaining performance over time.

### Lessons for Business and Life
1. **Leverage the right people**
   
    Effective growth is amplified by collaboration and expertise. Surrounding yourself with the right mentors and professionals accelerates progress, reduces errors, and transforms knowledge into actionable results. In
    2025, partnering with a professional coach translated into structured, efficient, and measurable improvement.

3. **Trust the process**
   
    Sustainable success requires patience and structured effort. Monitoring feedback, iterating deliberately, and adhering to a disciplined plan transforms consistent practice into long-term outcomes while mitigating risks
    and setbacks.

3. **Patience compounds**
   
   Foundations determine potential. Gradual, intentional development builds resilience, capacity, and reliability, creating leverage for future challenges. Skipping foundational steps may deliver short-term gains but
   increases the likelihood of failure; steady accumulation maximizes lasting impact.

##  Summary
Analyzing my marathon training data from 2023 and 2025 revealed striking differences in structure, intensity, and recovery, and clear early warning signs of injury in 2023 that I now understand and have learned from.

Diving into the data, creating graphs, and using GitHub and Markdown for the first time has been a valuable learning experience. I’m halfway to my big goal: **the Dead Sea Marathon 2026**, and feel better prepared, more focused, and on the right track.

I also want to take this opportunity to thank my coach, **Yuval Hay**, for her professionalism and guidance throughout my training.

I will continue to share updates.
